                <p className="text-xl my-10">You can also find out more about me under the dropdown menu where I go into some details on who I am and how I got started with miniature and modelkit painting.</p>
                <p className="text-xl mt-10">I also have some more things like my pre-painted collection, workstation, tools and upcoming projects that I have unopened and will paint at some point the the future.</p>
