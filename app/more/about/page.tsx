            <p className="my-10 text-xl">
                My name is Andr√©e. I'm 32 years old and I live in Sweden. Currently I'm studying to become a Front-End developer
                and this website is part of a school project im working on. <br/>
                This site is made in Next.JS, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.</p>
            <p className="my-10 text-xl">
                On my spare time I like to watch live streams on twitch.tv or live sports like football, hockey and motorsport. <br />
                My favorite sports event to watch is UEFA Champions League.
                I also like watching NHL when I'm able to due to time difference as the games often starts at 1am my time. <br />
                The teams I follow are The New York Rangers for NHL and Chelsea FC for the English Premier League. <br /> 
                For a few years now I've also been painting plastic model kits and miniature figures from different tabletop games. 
                I don't enjoy playing any tabeltop games I just really like painting the figures.
            </p>
            <h1 className="text-2xl underline text-center">How did I get started!</h1>
            <p className="my-10 text-xl">
                Many years ago now I started to buy collector editions from a few different games that I enjoyed. As my collection 
                got bigger and bigger I wanted to get more things from Star Wars as it's my favorite franchise. <br />
                I really like the Star Wars vehicles so I started to look into getting some. <br />
                I couldn't really find to many that I really liked that was the right size and best replicas that was pre-painted. 
                So this is when I started to look into plastic model kits that I had to paint by myself. <br />
                After alot of research I found what I was looking for and that's how I got started. <br />
                The first vehicle I painted was a Tie Fighter by Revell. <br /> 
                It came with paints in the box so I thought that was perfect. <br /> 
                Oh boy was I wrong. <br />
                Painting my first model kit didn't really go as planned. I didn't have many tools and knowledge at the time
                and I only had one brush that came in the same pack with the few paints for that model. <br />
                The paints that came with the model was also oil paints and I wasn't really happy with that as it's very hard 
                to clean the brushes after use. <br />
                But I managed at the time but the model itself didn't turn out at all like I wanted. I was really bad at it and
                didn't thin down the paints at all. And as I didn't have an airbrush I had to paint the model by hand. <br />
                When it was complete I thought it looked so bad that I threw it in the trash. It was only a $10 kit so 
                I didn't really care to much about it. <br />  
                It was at this point I decided to get better. I spent weeks looking at tutorials on youtube and then decided 
                to invest some more in to my hobby. This is when I got acrylic paints instead and an airbrush. <br />
                Acrylic paints are waterbased and are much easier to wash. <br /> 
                After this it was a smooth sailing and my "first" model was the Snowspeeder that you can find under 
                the category Revell. <br />
                I also got myself a new Tie Fighter but went with Bandai instead of Revell at a later date.

            <h1 className="text-2xl underline text-center">The process of building & painting!</h1>
            <p className="my-10 text-xl">
                I watched alot of youtube tutorials in the beginning and that's my recommendation 
                for anyone who wants to get started.</p>
            <div className="text-start">
                <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                    1. First I remove the parts from the plastic sprue to assemble the model following the 
                    instructions provided. I also remove any mould lines I can find.</p>
                <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                    2. I start to put together the parts using plastic glue. I use Tamiya Extra Thin Cement.</p>
                <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                    3. Priming the model with surface primer of your choise. 
                    I use Vallejo Surface Primer black or grey with my airbrush.</p>
                <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                    4. Base color for the model using my airbrush. I use ether Vallejo Model Air or 
                    Citadel Air paints and if needed I thin down the paint I want so I can use it for airbrushing.
                    Any color can be thinned down using ether water or airbrush thinner.
                </p>

            <p className="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl">
                That's my 4 step guide how get started. After that there is different types of techniques 
                to go forward. Everything from handpainting, drybrushing, contrast paints or airbrushing.
                It's all up to you how you want to proceed. 
            </p>
            <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                Contrast paints is something I've recently started to use. It's a very thin and more transparent 
                color by Citadel that you have to paint on in multiple layers. <br />
                I do it by hand but it can also be done with airbrush. <br />
                With this technique you need to have a good base coat on your model. <br /> 
                For example the Daemon Prince from Warhammer AoS that I've painted is mostly done with contrast paints. 
                That model started out with a solid light gray base coat with the use of many different contrast paints 
                all over the body and wings. <br /> 
                It's only the gold and silver parts on that model that's normal base/layer colors, 
                the rest is contrast paints with multiple layers.
            </p>
            <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                After getting all my base colors down I want to get some shades in to the model. 
                For the bigger vehicles I first use a gloss varnish to protect the base colors then use black or grey 
                panel line from Tamiya. <br />
                For my smaller models I use Citadel Shade colors.</p>
            <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                Then it's time for edge highlighting. This can be done with ether drybrushing 
                or by hand with a very small and fine brush. Edge highlighting basically simulates the effect
                of light reflecting off the highest points of the model. 
            </p>
            <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                Then there is the details and weathering effect. Make the model look clean or have a very 
                dirty look like some of my models do. <br />
                Then if the model has a base I paint that too</p>
            <p className="my-3 text-xl">
                The last thing I do is a coat of Vallejo Matt Acrylic Varnish to protect the model.</p>
