# Warhammer: Age of Sigmar

**Slaves to Darkness**

This one is part of the box set Slaves to Darkness Army Box Set from late 2022 but can be purchased separately as of early 2023.

This is probably the best looking model I've ever painted. It's all done by hand except the priming and base coat was done with airbrush.

One of the first models I've started to use Citadel's Contrast Paints.

Base Size: 60mm

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITED** in photoshop, only background.
