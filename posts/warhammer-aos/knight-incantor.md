# Warhammer: Age of Sigmar

**Stormcast Eternals**

These are all part of the box set: Tempest of Souls (No longer avalible)

I bought this box set because I loved the collection in here. Both Stormcast Eternals and Nighthaunt. Total 32 miniatures in this box set.

Base size: 40mm

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITID** in photoshop, only background.
