This is a T-70-X-Wing Starfighter and is the successor to the T-65B X-Wing Starfighter that Luke has.

This version was Poe Dameron's own with the code name Black One as it's stands out from other T-70-X-Wings due to a custom paintjob. The normal version is painted in blue and light gray.

This vehicle can be seen in Star Wars Episode 7-8. The same vehicle also appears in Episode 9 but with a new paintjob.

The scale of this model is 1/72 and is about 17cm long and 14.5cm wide.

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITID** in photoshop, only background.
