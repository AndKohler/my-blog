This is the TIE/In starfighter. This was the starfighter of the Galactic Empire.

The full name of it is Twin Ion Engine Space Superiority Starfighter.

This vehicle can be seen in Star Wars Episode 4-6, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and tv-shows.

This model is 1/72 scale and is about 10cm long and 9.5cm wide.

This model has also a full cockpit that I've painted with a pilot but It's to small to see or take pictures of.

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITED** in photoshop, only background.
