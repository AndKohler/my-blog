This is the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station, also known as Death Star MK.2

This model can be seen in the movie Star Wars Episode 6.

This model scale is 1/2700000 and the diameter of this model is about 6cm. 
It's little smaller then a tennis ball and the smallest model I have compared to it's real size.

After the first Death Star got blown up in Episode 4, the Empire started to construct a bigger version of it and it can be seen in space over the planet Endor being built by the Galactic Empire.

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITID** in photoshop, only background.
