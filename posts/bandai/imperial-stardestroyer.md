This is the Imperial II-class Star Destroyer.

The II-class was made for The Empire Strikes Back, so it does not appare in Episode 4. It can be seen in Star Wars Episode 5 and 6.

This model is 1/14500 scale and is about 11cm in lenght and 6cm wide. It's the second smallest vehicle models I own compared to it's real size.

This version was often looked as a command ship for the Galactic Empire.
