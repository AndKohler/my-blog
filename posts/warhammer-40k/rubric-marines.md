I thought these models looked very cool so decided to buy this box and paint them.

It took me a while to paint them because of all the details and the fact that there are 10 of these. But I'm happy with the result.

Base size: 32mm

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra one by one for best focus. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Models **NOT EDITED** in photoshop, only background.
