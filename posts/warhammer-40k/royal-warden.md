One of the first Warhammer models I started painting when I first started. 

It was part of the Warhammer 40,000 Recruit Edition box set. First Warhammer set I ever bought.

Base size: 32mm

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITED** in photoshop, only background.
