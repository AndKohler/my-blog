# Star Wars Legion

**B2-Series Super Battle Droids**

Also knows as Super Battle droids used by the Sepratists Confederacy droid army. They are more advanced than the B1 droids with thicker armor. They also don't require a command system to operate like the B1 droids do. However, they were designed with a simple processor, limiting their ability to formulate strategies and often had to rely on commanders or tactical droids to be more efficient in battle.

They can be seen in Star Wars Episode 2, 3 and tv-shows.

Base Size: 37mm
