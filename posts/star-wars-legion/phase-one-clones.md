# Star Wars Legion

**Phase-1 Clone Troopers**

Highly trained soldiers made for the Grand Army of the Republic. The clones was modeled on a human template, the Mandalorian bounty hunter Jango Fett. All clones had a hidden behavioral modification biochip implanted by the sith to, when the time was right turn on the Jedi Order.

As I had so many of the clone troopers I decided to paint some of them with different colors. 

The orange is the 212th Battalion with Commander Cody and General Obi-Wan Kenobi as leaders.
The blue is the 501st Legion with Captain Rex, Commander Ahsoka Tano and General Anakin Skywalker as leaders.

The 501st Legion later became the 501st Impreial Legion and was nicknamed Vader's fist in the Empire era.

The phase-1 clone troopers can be seen in Star Wars Episode 2 and tv-shows.
