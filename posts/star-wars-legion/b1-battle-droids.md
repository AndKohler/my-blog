# Star Wars Legion

**B1-Series Battle Droids**

The main battle droids used by the Sepratists Confederacy. The design of these droids made it easy to destroy them, The biggest advantage they had was overwhelming numbers. The first version required a command ship to activate and controll them. It was not until later on the planet Geonosis they got an upgrade and did not longer require a command ship.

They can be seen in Star Wars Episode 1-3 and tv-shows.
