This is the Venator-Class Star Destroyer used by the Galactic Republic in the Clone Wars.

This vehicle can be seen in Star Wars Episode 3 and tv-shows.

The scale of this model is 1/2274 and is about 50.5cm long and 23.5cm wide. It's the biggest vehicle model I have and also my favorite.
I also have an acrylic stand (middle pic 4) that I have it sitting on that I had to buy separately. 

This model version is the first release from 2005 by Revell and is very rare to find. Luckely I found it on Ebay for $160 so it's not a cheap model.

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITID** in photoshop, only background.
