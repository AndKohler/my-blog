This is the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank used by the U.S Army.

The M1A2 appeared in 1992 and in 2003 it saw it's first action, in operatons in Iraq.

The model is 1/35 scale and about 28cm long.

I built and painted this modelkit as a birthday present for my sisters fiance as he really likes military things.

Pictures taken with Samsung Galaxy S20. Then put into photoshop to make background white. Model **NOT EDITID** in photoshop, only background.
